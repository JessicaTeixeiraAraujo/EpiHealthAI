# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project relies on a respectful, collaborative community. We expect every contributor (maintainers, reviewers, users) to act professionally and help create a safe environment for everyone, regardless of background or experience level.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and inclusive; welcome new contributors.
- Provide constructive feedback and accept it graciously.
- Assume good intent and seek clarification before escalating disagreements.
- Protect confidential data (e.g., spreadsheets with business information, API keys) and report suspected leaks privately.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments (verbal, written, or visual).
- Sharing private or confidential information without permission.
- Knowingly submitting malicious code, exploits, or tools intended to harm other users.
- Any violations of corporate policies or applicable laws.

## Reporting

If you observe or experience unacceptable behavior:

1. Document the incident (dates, participants, context).
2. Contact the maintainers at `Jessica Teixeira Araujo` (replace with the appropriate alias) or escalate through the organization’s standard HR/security channels.
3. Reports will be handled confidentially. Retaliation is not tolerated.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans from the repository, reverting contributions, or notifying relevant departments. Repeat or severe offenses may result in additional disciplinary steps in accordance with company policy.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including repositories, issues, pull requests, documentation, chats, virtual meetings, and offline events representing the project.
