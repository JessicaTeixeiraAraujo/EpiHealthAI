## Overview

This project focuses on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to health and epidemiological data with the goal of making public health information more accessible, understandable, and user-friendly for citizens.
By leveraging AI techniques such as natural language processing and intelligent data analysis the project aims to transform complex health and epidemiological data into clear, natural-language responses. This approach allows non-technical users to consult health-related information, indicators, and insights without requiring specialized knowledge in data science, epidemiology, or information systems.
The initiative seeks to bridge the gap between technical health data and the general population by enabling more intuitive interactions between citizens and digital health systems. Ultimately, the project contributes to improved health literacy, transparency, and data-driven decision-making in public health contexts.

## Project Scope

The project will utilize publicly available health and epidemiological data provided by official Brazilian government sources, ensuring reliability, transparency, and consistency.

### Data Sources
- DATASUS: Official health information systems and datasets from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, including morbidity, mortality, hospitalizations, and epidemiological indicators.  
  Source: https://datasus.saude.gov.br/transferencia-de-arquivos/

- Official Epidemiological Bulletins: Periodic publications released by the Ministry of Health containing epidemiological analyses, surveillance updates, and public health reports.  
  Source: https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/centrais-de-conteudo/publicacoes/boletins

### Scope Definition
- Ingestion, processing, and analysis of structured and semi-structured public health data  
- Application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyze epidemiological datasets  
- Natural language interaction to allow citizens to query health data in an accessible manner  
- Translation of technical health data into clear, non-technical language  
- Support for public health monitoring, transparency, and data-driven insights
